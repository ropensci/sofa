\usage{
db_compact(cushion, dbname, as = "list", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{cushion}{A \code{\link{Cushion}} object. Required.}

\item{dbname}{Database name. Required.}

\item{as}{(character) One of list (default) or json}

\item{...}{Curl args passed on to \code{\link[crul]{HttpClient}}}
}
\value{
JSON as a character string or a list (determined by the
\code{as} parameter)

\description{
Request compaction of the specified database
}
\details{
Compaction compresses the disk database file by performing the following
operations:
\itemize{
\item Writes a new, optimised, version of the database file, removing any unused
sections from the new version during write. Because a new file is temporarily
created for this purpose, you may require up to twice the current storage space
of the specified database in order for the compaction routine to complete.
\item Removes old revisions of documents from the database, up to the per-database
limit specified by the _revs_limit database parameter.
}

Compaction can only be requested on an individual database; you cannot compact all
the databases for a CouchDB instance. The compaction process runs as a background
process. You can determine if the compaction process is operating on a database by
obtaining the database meta information, the compact_running value of the returned
database structure will be set to true. See GET /{db}. You can also obtain a list of
running processes to determine whether compaction is currently running.
